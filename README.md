## About
The Meme Exchange is an online web :computer: and mobile :iphone: platform which allows users to buy and sell memes for a profit :moneybag:.

## Inspiration
The Meme Exchange is inspired by the people over at https://reddit.com/r/memeeconomy which is a community of people who pretend to invest in memes with virtual currencies, and the best memes provide the highest return on investment (ROI).

Aside from the fact that this was a hilarious way to pass my time, I used this project as an outlet to which I could channel my entire frontend and backend web development learning process. 

I am super passionate about cutting edge technologies and I really loved reading the [Google Web Developer blogs](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/capabilities) to incorporate the latest browser tech into the frontend. I experimented with everything from PWAs using workbox APIs, isomorphic web apps, [Navigator APIs](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/credential-management/retrieve-credentials), NFC and fingerprint login APIs, state management with Vuex, and more!

## History
I have been working on this project on and off for around 3 years. The first iteration was made using Ruby on Rails and pure HTML/CSS/JS back in 2017. We launched on facebook and had almost 1,000+ users on the first day. Over time, the backend and frontend were separated and Vue.js was adopted for the frontend wheras the backend was made into an API. 

Just recently, I open sourced this project since I am no longer working on it. **If you are interested in picking this up where I left off, reach out to me!**
